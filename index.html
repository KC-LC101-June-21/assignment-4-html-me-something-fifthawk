         <article>There are many places that I would like to go in my lifetime, these are just a few examples from across the world! From the US, we have the Grand Canyon, and Seattle! From Asia, we have Seoul! From some other place I am not sure of, but think the event happens a lot of places, The Northern Lights!</article>
         
         <p> I would like to try and visit one new place every single year!</p>
